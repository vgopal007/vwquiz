To access your Django app from your phone, you'll need to make your development server accessible externally. Here are a few methods:
Method 1: Local Network
Find your computer's local IP address:
Windows: ipconfig (Command Prompt)
macOS/Linux: ifconfig (Terminal)
Example output: 192.168.1.100
Run your Django development server with:
Bash
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
On your phone, connect to the same Wi-Fi network and access:
http://<computer_ip>:8000
Example: http://192.168.1.100:8000
Method 2: ngrok
Download and install ngrok from .
Run ngrok:
Bash
ngrok http 8000
ngrok will generate a public URL:
http://<ngrok_url>.ngrok.io
Access this URL on your phone.
Method 3: Django Development Server with Public IP
Run your Django development server with:
Bash
python manage.py runserver <public_ip>:8000
Replace <public_ip> with your public IP address.
Method 4: Using an Emulator
Install an Android emulator (e.g., Android Studio) or iOS simulator.
Access http://127.0.0.1:8000 or http://localhost:8000 within the emulator.
Security Considerations:
Only use these methods for development purposes.
Be cautious when exposing your development server to external access.
Use authentication and authorization to protect sensitive data.
Production Deployment:
For production, consider deploying your Django app to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS), containerization (e.g., Docker), or a managed hosting service.
